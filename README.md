### Glad to see you here! &nbsp; ![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=wwwgomes.wwwgomes)

I am a back-end developer more focused on the Java language, having back-end I like any language. I love to program, play games, sing, and go to church.

As a developer I like to venture into paths I have never traveled before in order to gain more knowledge and experience.
